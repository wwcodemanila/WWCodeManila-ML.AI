    "Data pre-processing makes up a non-trivial chunk of a typical analysis workflow.  Even before any actual analysis begins, analysts find themselves needing to inspect elements, painstakingly uniformize format, check for and impute missing data, regularize variables, subset the data, and many similar activities.  In addition, during analysis proper, data are constantly being massaged every which way to fit the requirements of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data handling kung fu is therefore a very important skill to have when analyzing data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So what tool/s can one use for data handling?  \n",
    "\n",
    "For small, infrequent analyses, spreadsheets can often do the trick.  MS Excel, Libre Office Calculator, and Google Spreadsheets are all great tools that get the basics done quickly with very little investment in learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the data scales up, the time doing manual input also scales linearly.  The same 5-min task for 100 cells takes more than a month for 1M cells--if you never sleep.  Scripting functions from within the spreadsheets can be nifty, but only if your laptop/desktop doesn't slow down loading the data to the GUI--which it will.  Or perhaps, your spreadsheet won't even load all your data because of the limit on the number of columns and rows.  And what if this is a task that you have to do on a regular basis?  Maybe you're better off using another tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter python + the pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can do everything that you can do in a spreadsheet, and more!  Sky's the limit on rows or columns in pandas (rather, your RAM's the limit :P ).  It's fast, and scales well with data.  Best of all, it's easy to automate.  Because of all these, pandas has been seeing a steep growth since its introduction in 2011.  In Stackoverflow, pandas-tagged queries have been seeing the highest rate of traffic among other most asked-about python frameworks/libraries.  Finally, in 2018, the pandas tag received the highest traffic.\n",
